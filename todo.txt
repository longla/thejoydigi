### Technical SEO

1. **Ensure Mobile-Friendliness:**
   - The component already mentions mobile-friendly design, which is great. Ensure that all elements are responsive and test the site on various devices.

2. **Improve Site Speed:**
   - Optimize images using formats like WebP and ensure they are appropriately sized for different devices.
   - Consider lazy loading images to improve initial load times.

3. **Secure Your Site:**
   - Ensure that all API calls, like the one in `handleSubmit`, are made over HTTPS.

4. **Implement Structured Data:**
   - Use schema markup for services to help search engines understand the content better. This can be done using JSON-LD in the `<head>` section of your HTML.

### On-Page SEO

1. **Optimize Title Tags and Meta Descriptions:**
   - Ensure that each page has a unique title and meta description that includes primary keywords.

2. **Use Header Tags:**
   - Use appropriate header tags (H1, H2, H3) for structuring content. Ensure that the main title of the page is wrapped in an H1 tag.

3. **Optimize Images:**
   - Use descriptive file names and alt tags for images. This helps with accessibility and can improve image search rankings.

4. **Create Quality Content:**
   - The descriptions for services are informative, which is good. Ensure that content is regularly updated and includes relevant keywords naturally.

5. **Internal Linking:**
   - Use internal links to connect related content. This can help with navigation and distribute page authority across your site.

6. **Optimize URLs:**
   - Ensure URLs are clean and descriptive, including relevant keywords.

### Additional Recommendations

- **Accessibility:** Ensure that all interactive elements are accessible via keyboard and have appropriate ARIA labels.
- **Analytics:** Implement Google Analytics or similar tools to monitor traffic and user behavior.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular SEO audits to identify and fix issues.
