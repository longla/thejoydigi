## Environment Variables

The application uses the following environment variables:

```
# Email Configuration
EMAIL_HOST=smtp_host
EMAIL_PORT=587
EMAIL_SECURE=false
EMAIL_USER=your_email_username
EMAIL_PASS=your_email_password
EMAIL_FROM=sending_email_address
CONTACT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL=recipient_email_address
```

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT EMAIL CONFIGURATION NOTE ⚠️

Make sure `EMAIL_SECURE` is set to `false` in production. If set to `true`, the contact form email functionality will not work properly. This is because many SMTP providers (including Brevo) require that secure connection is set to false when using port 587 with STARTTLS.

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run production server
