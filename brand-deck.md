#### 👨‍💻 Founder Story (Long):

Hi, I'm Long — founder and developer of The Joy Digi.

I’ve spent over 10 years as a software engineer working with big tech companies, startups, and consulting firms. Throughout that journey, I’ve built everything from polished user-facing apps to robust internal systems, learning what really creates value for a business.

The Joy Digi is my way of combining that experience with a personal mission: helping others bring meaningful ideas to life. I believe in a **value-first approach** — where every project is designed not just to look good, but to make a real impact. Whether it’s a handcrafted website, a custom app, or a strategy session, it’s all about creating tools that truly serve your goals.
